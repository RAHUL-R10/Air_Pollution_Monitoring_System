IoT Based Air Pollution Monitoring System
This project is an IoT-based Air Pollution Monitoring System that monitors air quality using the MQ135 gas sensor. It displays the air quality in PPM (parts per million) on an LCD and a webpage accessible from anywhere over the internet. Additionally, it triggers an alarm when the air quality goes below a certain level, indicating the presence of harmful gases like CO2, smoke, alcohol, benzene, and NH3.

Circuit Diagram and Explanation
Explain the connections and circuit diagram here. Provide a clear and concise explanation of how the components are connected together.

Working Explanation
Explain how the Air Pollution Monitoring System works. Describe how the MQ135 sensor senses different gases and how it converts the output into PPM. Mention the safe air quality level and the corresponding actions taken by the system when the air quality exceeds certain thresholds.

How to Use
Provide instructions on how to set up and use the Air Pollution Monitoring System. Include step-by-step guidelines on assembling the hardware components, uploading the code to the Arduino, and accessing the webpage to monitor air quality remotely.

Installation
Clone the repository.
Upload the Arduino sketch to the Arduino Uno.
Set up the hardware components as described in the circuit diagram.
Power on the system and access the webpage to monitor air quality.
