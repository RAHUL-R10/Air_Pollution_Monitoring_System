# IoT Based Air Pollution Monitoring System

This project is an IoT-based Air Pollution Monitoring System that monitors air quality using the MQ135 gas sensor. It displays the air quality in PPM (parts per million) on an LCD and a webpage accessible from anywhere over the internet. Additionally, it triggers an alarm when the air quality goes below a certain level, indicating the presence of harmful gases like CO2, smoke, alcohol, benzene, and NH3.
